Ticket #1: Implement Queue System for Discord Bot

Objective: Implement a queue system for managing YouTube audio playback in the Discord bot.

Description:
The Discord bot should manage a dynamic queue system that handles YouTube audio tracks. This involves storing track details and handling queue operations through .json files.

Tasks:

    Data Structure Design:
        Design a data structure for the queue to store the following information for each entry:
            video_url: URL of the YouTube video
            title: Title of the video
            is_playlist: Boolean indicating if the video is from a playlist
            playlist_index: Index of the video in the playlist, if applicable
            Additional placeholders for future metadata (e.g., duration, uploader)

    Queue Storage:
        Implement functionality to write the current state of the queue to a .json file at regular intervals and upon significant changes (e.g., adding or removing an item).
        Ensure that each queue is named based on the current date for uniqueness and is stored in a way that multiple queues can be managed and accessed historically.

    Queue Management:
        Develop methods to load and manage multiple queues based on their names and creation dates, allowing for retrieval and manipulation of specific queues as required by the user commands.

Expected Behaviors:

    Error Handling: If the bot encounters an unsupported URL or an unavailable video during the queue operations:
        Log the error with a specific message indicating the nature of the issue (e.g., "Video not available" or "URL format not recognized").
        Display a user-friendly message in the Discord chat to inform about the issue.
    Queue Limits: There is no set maximum number of entries in a queue at this time. The system should be capable of handling dynamically sized queues, but performance implications of extremely large queues should be monitored.

Questions Answered:

    Maximum Queue Entries: No maximum limit. System should scale as needed but monitor for performance issues.
    Exception Handling: Detailed logging and user notifications for unsupported URLs or unavailable videos are required.
